## Elm App

### Game Rules
 This app is based on a gambling game called craps, which involves a dice roll.
 The rules are as followed: 
   - Roll a 7 or 11 on your first roll, and you win the round
   - Roll a 2, 3, or 12 on your first roll, and you lose the round
   - Roll any other combination that is not the above choices and this
     number becomes your target roll. Then you continue to roll again 
     until either the target is rolled (Round win), or a 7 or 11 is 
     rolled (Round loss)

### How to Use
 I have designed my app to look like a classic arcade cabinet! To play the 
 game of craps on it follow the rules below:

 - Select a bet amount using the green, blue, or red buttons (Betting amounts
   of 100, 200, and 300 credits respectively)
 - Press the yellow button to complete your first roll, and see the result of the
   roll displayed on the screen
 - If the first roll is not a win/loss, then press the grey button to continue 
   rolling until a round win or round loss is determined
 - The game ends once the user reaches 2000 credits to win, or 0 credits as a loss
 - Score is determined by the bet amount (Riskier bets means higher score!)
 - If you wish to play again, or reset the game at any time, press the orange dollar
   sign button below to reset to a new game

NOTE: Game was changed from initial proposal.
