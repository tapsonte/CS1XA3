* Features included for Part 1 of this project: (5.1 & 5.2).
  More to come for Part 2!

* This script is a user prompted interactive script.
  The user simply runs the script like any other via ./
  and proceeds to follow instructions. The user is prompted
  for a number (1-6) depending on which feature they want to
  use, and the script does said feature; 1-5 will be features
  assigned according to the assignment outline, 6 to terminate
  the script.

* NOTE: The todo.log is placed in the CS1XA3 directory after
  the TODO log feature is used during script run time.
